<p><b>GopherConIndia 2015</b>, taking place for the first time in India, is accepting all types of talk proposals <b>upto October 31st, 2014</b>.

We're looking forward to receiving your best proposals for talks.</p>

<p>Anyone with any level of Go knowledge is a candidate for a great topic at this conference. As we will get attendees of all kinds, we need speakers of all kinds. In all ways and manners, we will try to assemble the most diverse conference we can, and we do that with your help.</p>
<p>These are the traditional talk sessions given during the main conference days, Friday through Saturday. They're mostly 30 minutes long, but we may offer a limited number of 45 minute slots.</p>
<p>As for the topic, that's up to you. We want something for everyone. We want the hot topics in the community right now. We also want the hot topics for the future. Where is Go going? You tell us. You're the people who make those decisions and we want to share them.</p>
<p>GopherConIndia is entirely volunteer-organized and run, and works hard to keep costs as low as possible.</p>

<p class="gci-bold">As such:</p>

<ul class="gci-unordered-list">

<li><b>Selected</b> speakers currently residing outside India, should check if their company can sponsor them to the GopherConIndia. If not, <em>we will try</em> and help them with some travel honorarium.</li>
<li>If we get a deserving woman speaker, then we would be happy to sponsor her.</li>
<li>All other selected speakers residing in India will have to make their own arrangements for travel to, boarding and lodging in Bangalore, India.</li>
<li>There is <b>no talk remuneration</b> to any speaker whether he/she is an invited / selected foreign or Indian speaker.</li>
</ul>

<p class="gci-bold">Finally do note that:</p>

<ul class="gci-unordered-list">
<li>we are accepting only single participant talks.</li>
<li>you can submit as many talk proposals as you want.</li>
<li>if your talk is selected, we will need your talk slides latest by 31st Jan. 2015.</li>
</ul>
<p>You don't need to be a well traveled professional speaker to get on stage at GopherConIndia. What matters is the topics, the materials, and the drive to present great things to this community.</p>
