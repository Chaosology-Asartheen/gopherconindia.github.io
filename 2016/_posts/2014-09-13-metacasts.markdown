[MetaCasts](http://www.metacasts.tv/) are weekly screencasts that focus on Go and JavaScript (as it relates to Go). Each week a new video is released covering topics from testing, building, tooling, and maintaining Go applications. MetaCasts can be watched on your computer, tablet, and mobile phone in glorious HD.

We are happy to extend our full support for this exciting event and proud to be honored as supporters for GopherConIndia 2015. Looking forward to this great event and hope it turns out to be a huge success.
