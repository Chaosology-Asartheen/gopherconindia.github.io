Qwinix Technologies - First Gold Sponsor of GopherCon India 2015
----------------------------------------------------------------

GopherConIndia welcomes the open-source development team at [Qwinix Technologies](http://www.qwinixtech.com/) as the first Gold sponsor of GopherConIndia 2015. As the first Go conference to be held in India, event sponsorship is a great way for leading companies to demonstrate their support for the growing, global Gopher herd.

Qwinix Technologies has been an advocate of the Go programming language and its potential. Qwinix appreciates its continued adoption by great organizations like Bit.ly, Mozilla and Canonical, as well as the expanding Gopher community with which its development team mingles.

"Go is a powerful language that streamlines sophisticated applications," said Darshan Puttannaiah, founder of Qwinix Technologies. "Our multidisciplinary team has closely followed the Go movement and is looking forward to the knowledge-sharing and networking that make these conferences so valuable to the open-source community."
