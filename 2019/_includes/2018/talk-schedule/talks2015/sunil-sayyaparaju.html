			<p>With the advent of real-time data processing systems, the move to high performance databases has effected major design changes to technology stack of Internet enterprises. Not only the languages are simpler and more expressive, but the move to asynchronous micro-services and leaner architectures has necessitated newer design paradigms, in which the application becomes a more involved part of the data storage system. Aerospike has been among the fore-runners of integrating a more involved part of the data access library in its Smart Clients. Go, by providing a non-blocking runtime and native concurrency features in the language, has proved a natural pick. In this presentation, I will discuss how we employ gopher armies to keep data streaming in our Smart Client design.</p>

				<!--Khosrow Afroozeh is a member of the engineering team at Aerospike. His professional interests include Distributed Systems, Programming Languages, Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence. He started using Go the day it was announced, and never looked back. He has developed render farms, massive distributed monitoring systems and fast database drivers in Go. Nowadays, it is not uncommon to see him lead massive gopher armies in production.-->
				Sunil Sayyaparaju, Director of Product and Technology at Aerospike, has over 10 years experience working on different types of SQL RDBMS solutions, such as single machine (monolithic), in-memory, distributed shared-disk, and distributed shared-nothing architectures with emphasis in transaction management, storage, access, performance tuning, and recovery areas. Sunil currently leads Aerospike's Bangalore office, working on their distributed shared-nothing NoSQL solution. Aerospike is a high-performance, self-balancing, immediately consistent, distributed NoSQL database. Aerospike also has an add on product for replication across data-centers over WAN which supports different complex topologies.
