GopherConIndia spoke to Couchbase (GopherConIndia's Gold Sponsor).

Qs. Can you tell us about your company and what you'll do?

[Couchbase](http://www.couchbase.com/) provides the world's most complete, most scalable and best performing NoSQL database. Couchbase Server is designed from a simple yet bold vision: build the first and best, general-purpose NoSQL database. That goal has resulted in an industry leading solution that includes a shared nothing architecture, a single node-type, a built in caching layer, true auto-sharding and the world's first NoSQL mobile offering: Couchbase Mobile, a complete NoSQL mobile solution comprised of Couchbase Server, Couchbase Sync Gateway and Couchbase Lite. Couchbase Server and all Couchbase Mobile products are open source projects. Couchbase counts many of the world's biggest brands as its customers, including AT&T, Amadeus, Bally's, Beats Music, Cisco, Comcast, Concur, Disney, eBay / PayPal, Neiman Marcus, Orbitz, Rakuten / Viber, Sky, Tencent, Tesco, Verizon and Willis Group, as well as hundreds of other household names worldwide. Couchbase is headquartered in Silicon Valley, and has raised $115 million in funding from Accel Partners, Adams Street Partners, Ignition Partners, Mayfield Fund, North Bridge Venture Partners and WestSummit.

**Qs**. What are your company's future plans?

As the leader in NoSQL our goal is to continue to empower our customers and the  development community with strong product offerings. We will continue to innovate and bring to market exciting product offerings like the Mobile Platform we brought to market in 2014. 

**Qs**. Is Couchbase using Go or planning on using it in the near future?

Couchbase makes extensive use of Go. Our mobile platform Sync Gateway is written entirely using the Go language. An official Go SDK will be released later this year.

Go has experienced widespread community adoption, and a community SDK can be found here: [https://github.com/couchbaselabs/go-couchbase](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/go-couchbase).

Couchbase Mobile Sync Gateway written using the Go language can be found here on [Github](https://github.com/couchbase/sync_gateway).

**Qs**. Where do you see Go in the foreseeable future?

Several Couchbase components are built using the Go language for future release including a new query engine. We will continue to develop additional Go language features and expand the current offerings around our mobile platform. 

**Qs**. What is your impression about the Go programming scene in India?

We see wide scale adoption of the Go Language in India. There are several large projects happening in India using Go. Our office in Bangalore has several customers building applications in Go, and we continue to see rapid growth of the language. There are frequent Go meetups in most major Indian Cities, and we expect to see the language to continue to gain traction.

**Qs**. Why did you decide to sponsor GopherConIndia?

Go is a language of the future, and will continue to experience wide scale adoption. Couchbase has made a significant investment into projects in the Go language and India is one of our most important markets. To support our rapid growth in India and the rapid growth of the Go language, sponsoring GopherConIndia is a natural fit for us. We are excited about the future of our products in India and our continued use of the Go language.
