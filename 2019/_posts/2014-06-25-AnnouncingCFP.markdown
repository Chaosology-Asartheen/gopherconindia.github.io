We are very happy to announce that the [CFP](https://gopherconindia.com/call-for-proposal/) for GopherConIndia is now open and we are accepting all types of Go-related talk proposals upto **October 31st, 2014**. You can submit your talk proposal [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1WlCvI8E0WFdcZ9G7XeJm_QJykRzemNl9GJ39kVwN7WM/viewform). 

GopherConIndia 2015 will be held on 20-21 February 2015 in Bangalore, India. Anyone with any level of Go knowledge is a candidate for a great topic at this conference. As we will get attendees of all kinds, we need speakers of all kinds. In all ways and manners, we will try to assemble the most diverse conference we can, and we do that with your help. As for the topic, that's up to you. We want something for everyone. We want the hot topics in the community right now. We also want the hot topics for the future. Where is Go going? You tell us. You're the people who make those decisions and we want to share them.

 __First things first though.__  

Should you submit a talk? Do you have any questions or doubts about the conference; preparing a slide deck or talking in front of strangers? We're more than happy to help out. For more details, we will recommend you to checkout [Proposal Advice](https://gopherconindia.com/proposal-advice/).

The selection process is anonymous, your personal information will be hidden from us until after the selection process. We consider our gophers as supportive, welcoming and those who implement a [Code of Conduct](https://gopherconindia.com/code-of-conduct/) to back up that sentiment.

I hope you [submit a proposal](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1WlCvI8E0WFdcZ9G7XeJm_QJykRzemNl9GJ39kVwN7WM/viewform) and that we shall see you in February 2015!
