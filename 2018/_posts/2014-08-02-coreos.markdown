[CoreOS](https://coreos.com/) is a new Linux OS that has been re-architected to provide the foundation of warehouse scale computing. The strategies and architectures that influence CoreOS allow companies like Google, Facebook and Twitter to run their services at scale with high resilience. CoreOS runs on your existing hardware and on cloud providers. Follow CoreOS on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/coreoslinux).

We're excited to support GopherConIndia. Go GopherConIndia!
