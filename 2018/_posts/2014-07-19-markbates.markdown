Mark spends his days focusing on new application development and consulting for his clients. At night he writes books, raises kids, and occasionally he forms a band and "tries to make it". Mark is the author of three books, "Distributed Programming with Ruby" (2009), "Programming in CoffeeScript" (2012), and "Conquering the Command Line" (2014). He also runs the weekly Golang screencast site, [www.metacasts.tv](http://www.metacasts.tv/).
