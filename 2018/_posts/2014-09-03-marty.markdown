[Marty Schoch](https://twitter.com/mschoch) is a software engineer at Couchbase. As a part of the Couchbase Labs team, Marty has built many experimental projects in Go, contributing to its increased adoption inside Couchbase. The most successful of these projects was N1QL, an SQL-like query language for Couchbase Server. He is also a core contributor to the Go Couchbase SDK. Currently, Marty is leading development of [bleve](http://www.blevesearch.com/), a modern text indexing library for Go.

Marty is a speaker at GopherConIndia 2015 and his talk is on "bleve - modern text indexing for Go."

Nearly every application today has a search component. But delivering high quality search results requires a long list of text analysis and indexing techniques. With the bleve library, we bring advanced text indexing and search to your Go applications.

This talk will start with a brief introduction to text search concepts. We'll discuss the importance of choosing the right analyzer for your text. Then we'll look at examples that demonstrate how to index your existing data model. Finally, we'll look at how you can integrate advanced features, like result highlighting and faceting, to complete the user experience.

_Please feel free to post here your thoughts/suggestions about his proposed talk._
