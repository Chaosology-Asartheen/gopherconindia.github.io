				Many Rubyist take a look at Go and wonder if they should learn it. Many dabble in Go and then go back to the warm embrace of Ruby 
				while others dive head first into the Go community and never look back.
			</p>
			<p>
				This talk leads you on a journey that starts with an explanation of my personal journey into the Go community and hopefully ends 
				with you taking the plunge yourself. Along the way, we will talk about why Rubyists should consider Go as the next language to learn, 
				give some concrete steps on how to get started learning the language and demonstrate some of the differences between the languages that 
				tend to cause Rubyists to struggle.
