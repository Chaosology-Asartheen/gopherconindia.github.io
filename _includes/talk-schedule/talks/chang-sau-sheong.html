				We often build our software applications like the Pyramids of Giza -- to last an eternity -- without realising that by the time we complete 
				our  masterpiece, the libraries we use to build it with, or even the programming language with use has moved on. Meanwhile, the requirements 
				for our eternal monument has changed, our business model has pivoted and we're left to scramble to catch up.
				<br ><br >
Instead of building static monoliths, we should build for gradual and eventual changes. Instead of building with a fixed set of 
tools â€” programming languages and libraries -- we should embrace multiple programming languages and libraries, all used within the same application.
				<br ><br >
Polyglot is a web framework (partly written in Go) built for this purpose. Polyglot enables programmers to build dynamically scalable and extensible 
web applications, using multiple programming languages, or versions of programming languages and libraries, at the same time.
				<br ><br >
In this talk, I will introduce Polyglot and show how a single web application can be developed in multiple programming languages, 
and run in multiple platforms. I will also show how new features can be dynamically added to the same application, allowing us to gradually grow our 
application.
