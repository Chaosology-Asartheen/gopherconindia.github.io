			<p>Metaprogramming, the process of writing programs that generate, modify, or analyze other programs (or themselves), is often associated with languages like Ruby and C++. But metaprogramming can be extremely useful in Go, as well, and Go has great libraries to support it. This talk will go over a few examples of how metaprogramming can make your life as a Go programmer easier, and how we've used these techniques to build, test, and ship a large-scale Go web app.</p>
