				At this moment in time, Go is most likely not the first language of the people who write it. You can often see the traces of other languages in code written by people who aren't proficient in your languages of choice. For example it is Ruby but it looks and feels like Java.</p>
            <p>Like herding gophers, it is easy to force something you don't understand to do what you are comfortable with. The trick is to learn the beauty of the language and let its powers shape your thinking and style.
