In the intervening time he has built world beating test systems, co-designed award winning products, run his own instrumentation company for over fifteen years, learned and actually used more than two dozen programming languages at a professional level, and taught courses from hobby to degree level on subjects as diverse as IOT, e-commerce and Image Processing.
