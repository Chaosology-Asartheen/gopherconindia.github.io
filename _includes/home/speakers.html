          <p class="about-speaker">Dave Appleton has been messing around with things since sometime before the dawn of time. Mentored by people with more technical expertise than interpersonal skills and business sense, Dave started programming in 1968 in FORTRAN, building audio systems about the same time and messing with digital logic in 1976. In the intervening time he has built world beating test systems, co-designed award winning products, run his own instrumentation company for over fifteen years, learned and actually used more than two dozen programming languages at a professional level, and taught courses from hobby to degree level on subjects as diverse as IOT, e-commerce and Image Processing. For the last three years he has been working on crypto currencies and financial technology.</p>
