You have a new range of Apps that are always available and ready to complete complex tasks, as if you were interacting with a human. This talk takes a look at how you can write Bots on Slack, one of the most popular messaging platform in recent times. A key part of the Slack ecosystem is the availability of multiple APIs that makes it easier to extend the platform. Golang is an ideal way to write Slack Bots due to great support for web protocols and the availability of high quality libraries. We shall take a look at how you can write Bots that listen to everyone that you type, accept commands and execute something in return or notify your teams of external events.</p>

          <p><strong>Talk: Building High Performance APIs In Go Using gRPC And Protocol Buffers</strong></p>
          <p class="about-speaker">This session will demonstrate how to build high-performance, massively-scalable APIs in Go using Google’s gRPC and Protocol Buffers. The session will introduce how to use gRPC as a communication protocol for Microservices architecture. By using gRPC with Protocol Buffers, you can build high performance APIs, which can provide high performance and scalability power than JSON based RESTful APIs. gRPC is a high performance, open-source remote procedure call (RPC) framework from Google, which can run anywhere. It enables client and server applications to communicate transparently, and makes it easier to build connected systems. By default, gRPC uses Protocol Buffers as the Interface Definition Language (IDL) and as its underlying message interchange format. Protocol Buffers, also referred as protobuf, is Google’s language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data. Protocol Buffers are smaller, faster, and simpler that provides high performance than other standards such as XML and JSON. systems by implementing various messaging patterns. gRPC is built with mobile clients in mind that will give you lot of performance advantages and easiness for consuming APIs.</p>

          <p><strong>Talk: Package Oriented Design</strong></p>
          <p class="about-speaker">You have learned the language and now you are ready to start building your product. Sounds easy but where do you begin? Go is not like other languages in the sense that you can’t organize your source code using folders. If you do, you are going to have problems. This is because each folder in your source tree represents a package. A self contained unit of compiled code. The better job you do in identifying the unique packages you need to solve the problem, the easier your projects will be to manage, support and grow over time. Developer productivity on the project will directly relate to how well you design your packages and their API. This has been my experience and this is what I will share with you in this talk. My best practices and guidelines to package oriented design.</p>
