  <strong>Q. I had purchased a conference / workshop ticket but now my plan has changed. Will you refund my money?</strong>
  <p>We had mentioned at the time of buying the ticket, that it is non-refundable. However, we will try and help you find buyers for your ticket.
    Once you sell your ticket, do inform us the purchaser's name so that we can print the attendee badge in his/her name.</p>

  <strong id="4">Q. How many tracks will the talks be organized into?</strong>
  <p>We love going to conferences that don't make you choose between two great presentations. So we created GopherConIndia as a single-track event that you don't want to miss and where everyone gets the opportunity to see the same talks. We think you'll enjoy the speakers we're lining up so much, you won't want to miss anyone of them.</p>

    day 2 will start at 9:00 am and run upto 4:30pm. This is subject to change.</p>
