			<p>Every once in a while, a new programming language comes up that fundamentally changes how we think about computing. But even more so often, the core ideas behind a "new" language are hinged upon ideas that were first propounded by languages or systems which are much older; f.ex. first-class functions originated in the '60s but have become mainstream only recently.<br /><br />Often our understanding of a language's features and the intentions thereof are limited by our understanding of its roots.<br /><br />In this talk, BG will talk about the origins of the core ideas behind Go and will take you on a "language-archeology" tour where we'll trace the roots of Go.</p>
