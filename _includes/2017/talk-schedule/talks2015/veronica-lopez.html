			<p>This talk will show the audience the main perks of Go as a concurrent language explained by how slices, maps and channels work together, and how the fundamentals of these data structures really make the difference between Go and other languages.</p>
			<p>The following topics will be covered:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Super brief introduction explaining the point of creating efficient data structures, as opposed to just writing compilable code.</li>
				<li>Comparison of concurrent data structures in Android (Java) with the ones in Go (how they work, their roles and examples of implementation)</li>
				<li>Tips on how to prevent deadlocks, starvation and premature termination through a correct management of suitable data structures and other resources.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Preliminary general outline can be found at: <a href="https://github.com/Verolop/concurrency-by-data-structures">https://github.com/Verolop/concurrency-by-data-structures</a></p>
