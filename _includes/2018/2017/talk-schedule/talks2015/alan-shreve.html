			<p>Channels are the preferred mechanism for safely sharing state between concurrent goroutines. They are a powerful abstraction that makes concurrent code easy to reason about and simple to write. Most Go resources, however, have little to say about how to design APIs that use channels. This talk will discuss the principles both how and when it is appropriate to use channels in Go APIs drawing on examples from the standard library, official Go repositories, and more.</p>
