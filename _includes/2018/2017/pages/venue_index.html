  <p>About a 4-hour drive from Mumbai, Pune seemed an idyllic place with a laid-back attitude. But now the little town has metamorphosed into a buzzing metropolis and is today fast emerging as an InfoTech hub.</p>
  <p>Pune, is the ideal location for our third Indian Go conference. With being host to many global software companies for many years, Pune boasts some of the best world-class restaurants and a great nightlife to round out your conference downtime.</p>
