			<p>N1QL (pronounced as "nickel") - is Couchbase's next generation query language. N1QL presents easy and familiar abstractions to quickly develop scalable applications that work with next generation database systems. N1QL builds on the SQL language and includes many of SQL's features in addition to features associated with document-oriented databases, i.e. it supports schema less JSON documents, nested attributes and domain oriented normalization.  N1QL has been built entirely using golang and in this talk we will explore the architecture N1QL.</p>
