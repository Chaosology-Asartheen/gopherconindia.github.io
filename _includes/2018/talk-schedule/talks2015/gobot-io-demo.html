			<p>The robotics evolution has already begun. You can buy drones and robotic devices at local retail stores. Unfortunately, it’s been hard to develop code for robots, and nearly impossible to create solutions that integrate multiple different kind of devices. That's why we created Gobot, a framework written in the Go programming language. Gobot can communicate with many different kinds of hardware devices, and integrate them together. With surprisingly few lines of code, you can write interesting applications that tie together Arduinos, ARDrones, Spheros, and more… even all at the same time! The time has come for Go powered robotics, and Gobot is here to help!</p>
