			<p>Go has been attracting a lot of attention mostly for web applications. Research communities dealing with a lot of simulations usually don't use advanced programming techniques for thier work. They usually rely on third party tools like Matlab, octave and R or native languages like C/C++. Especially, in the area of wireless research, to capture a 1 minute snapshot of a 4G communication system of 500+ users and 50 base-stations typically takes about a weeks time. In a system level simulation, there are lot of functionalities that can be executed concurrently. The simplicity of Go's concurrency can help accelerate the coding and simulation times.<br /><br />We noticed a performance improvement of 2x when compared to a C code for a simple wireless point-to-point link simulation (QPSK AWGN). This motivated us to build a full-fledged simulation platform based on golang, which can be hosted on cloud services like GCE. In this talk, we will discuss the background of the research problem and the subsequent golang based framework which we have designed for both backend and front-end.</p>
