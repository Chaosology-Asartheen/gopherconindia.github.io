[Jiahua Chen](https://twitter.com/joe2010xtmf) is a Gopher, web application developer and open source author, who is also the creator of [Go Walker](https://gowalker.org/), [Gopm](https://github.com/gpmgo/gopm), [Gogs](http://gogs.io/) and [Macaron](https://github.com/Unknwon/macaron). He is very active on the GitHub and named himself "coding addict". Besides, he is a video course maker and publisher as a verified teacher at [NetEase Cloud Class](http://study.163.com/u/Obahua) and [UCAI](http://www.ucai.cn/4347.html). His mission is to inspire more people to learn Go in China.

Qs. Why and when did you decide to start working with Go?

_Jiahua:_ It's actually an accident that I got started with Go, and I believe Go is new and for the young generation like me, so I continue working with it. I have a long time experience with another programming language wrapper by Chinese which also use static link compilation, I understand the benefits of it.

**Qs**. What are you currently working on?

_Jiahua:_ I'm currently working on [Gogs](http://gogs.io/) and other projects that are related to it. The goal of this project is to make the easiest, fastest and most painless way to set up a self-hosted Git Service.

**Qs**. Where do you see Go in the foreseeable future?

_Jiahua:_ Go is already awesome on the server side; client side (desktop and mobile) with native GUI is the next big thing to do with it. Regardless of the platform, Go-QML is the best one right now.

**Qs**. How should one go about acquiring knowledge and skills in Go? What's the best approach?

_Jiahua:_ Exercises and doing projects is the real approach to make others' knowledge of my own. Looking and thinking are always 1 million times easier than writing an actual line of code. My way to study Go is to use a package, found not enough, develop my fork, hopefully give a pull request.

**Qs**. Which areas in Go should a would-be Go programmer concentrate on, in your opinion?

_Jiahua:_ I don't think there is a unique answer, everything is possible. But for now, I mostly use Go for command line tools and web apps.

**Qs**. How excited are you about GopherConIndia 2015?

_Jiahua:_ Very excited. I have never been to India before. I have been preparing for my talk ever since there was only a Logo on the gophercon.in site.

**Qs**. Do you have any parting words for our readers? Anything you would like to share with them?

_Jiahua:_ Don't waste time on comparing and arguing about computer languages; pick the one you feel you like and fall in love with it!

_Thanks Jiahua for sharing your views with us. I am confident that your insights would help all the would-be Go programmers. In case you have any queries and/or questions, kindly post your questions here (as comments to this blog post) and Jiahua would be glad to answer._
