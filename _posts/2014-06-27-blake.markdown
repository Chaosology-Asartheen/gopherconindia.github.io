[Blake Mizerany](https://twitter.com/bmizerany) after starting his career as a developer at a handful of Fortune 500 companies, Blake became one of Heroku’s first hires, focusing on research, development, and distributed systems engineering for the next five years. He is the creator of the Ruby framework [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) and co-creator of the distributed data store [Doozer](https://github.com/ha/doozer). Blake is an active member of the Go community, and passionate about ruthlessly simplifying developer experiences.

You can often find Blake evangelizing about the things he loves around the world, riding his bike all over San Francisco, or scaling rock walls. He recently joined the team at [CoreOS](https://twitter.com/coreoslinux).
