GopherCon India is a conference for the growing international community of Go programmers. The challenge to properly educate and train developers is one that [GoingGo Training](http://www.goinggotraining.net/) is taking head on. Even though many developers can quickly start using Go to build applications, there is a learning curve on how to leverage the standard library and language idioms effectively. Applying Go's idioms lead to more robust and natural applications while helping to trim down development timeframes. The focus of GoingGo Training is to teach these idioms in a practical way so developers can be more productive and write better code.

GoingGo Training provides on-site corporate and individual training classes for the Go programming language. They have developed a bootcamp style 2 day course to help existing programmers learn the features of the language and how to write idiomatic Go. They can also develop specialized training programs to meet your specific needs.

GoingGo Training will be conducting a one day Go workshop on 19th Feb. 2015, one day before the GopherConIndia conference in Bangalore, India.
