[William Kennedy](https://twitter.com/goinggodotnet) is a managing partner at Ardan Studios in Miami, FL, a mobile and web app development company. He is also a co-author of the book [Go In Action](http://www.goinactionbook.com/), the author of the blog [GoingGo.Net](http://goinggo.net/) and the organizer for the Go and MongoDB meetups in Miami. Bill is focused on Go education and through his new venture [GoingoGo Training](http://www.goinggotraining.net/), Bill continues the cause by working with individuals and groups who want to take their Go knowledge and coding skills to the next level. Here, in this brief interview, the GopherConIndia team talks to William Kennedy.

Qs. Why and when did you decide to start working with Go?

_William:_ I needed to move from Windows to Linux and start building services and backend processes.

**Qs**. What are you currently working on?

_William:_ Ardan Studios works on client projects and uses Go for many of the API's and backend processes. We also have a product called OutCast which is a mobile weather app for Fishermen.

**Qs**. Where do you see Go in the foreseeable future?

_William:_ I think the next evolution for Go will be support for building desktop and mobile applications. Currently Pietro Gagliardi is working on a platform native GUI library that will support [desktop application development](https://github.com/andlabs/ui). Guastavo Niemeyer is working on a [QML library](https://github.com/go-qml/qml) which can support both desktop and mobile application development.

**Qs**. How should one go about acquiring knowledge and skills in Go? What's the best approach?

_William:_ Find a project to work on and make it happen. Then continually refactor the application as you learn more. Leverage the mailing list and the [Gopher Academy Slack group](https://gophers.slack.com/) to meet other Gophers and get help. [Dave Cheney's blog](http://dave.cheney.net/) and the [GoingGo blog](http://www.goinggo.net/) are also great places to start.

**Qs**. Which areas in Go should a would-be Go programmer concentrate on, in your opinion?

_William:_ This depends on the projects they are working on.

**Qs**. How excited are you about GopherConIndia 2015?

_William:_ Super excited to have been chosen to speak at the first GopherCon India. This will also be my first time in India and I can't wait.

**Qs**. Do you have any parting words for our readers? Anything you would like to share with them?

_William:_ Learning a new programming language can be a frustrating experience for anyone. The Go community is incredibility active and you are not alone. Take advantage of all the documentation, blogs, local Meetups and groups like Slack that exist today. Don't be afraid to ask your questions and get involved.

_Thanks William for sharing your views with us. I am confident that your insights would help all the would-be Go programmers. In case you have any queries and/or questions, kindly post your questions here (as comments to this blog post) and William would be glad to answer._
