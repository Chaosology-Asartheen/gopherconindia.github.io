GopherConIndia spoke to Darshan Puttannaiah, Founder and CEO at Qwinix Technologies (GopherConIndia's First Gold Sponsor).

Qs. Can you tell us about your company and what you'll do?

_Darshan:_ We are software services provider, helping our clients bring their ideas to market by leveraging Agile, Lean and Continuous Delivery, with a global delivery model. We specialize in Web and Mobile Application development and DevOps using open source technologies.

**Qs**. What are your company's future plans?

_Darshan:_ We have plans of expansion in the US and from a technology side we are looking to drive Go along with open source technology adoption by supporting local community events and talks.

**Qs**. Is Qwinix using Go or planning on using it in the near future?

_Darshan:_ Yes, we are using Go now for some of our DevOps tasks. We have proposed adopting Go to some of our clients and have a few of our clients onboard to start using it for backend application development for now.

**Qs**. Where do you see Go in the foreseeable future?

_Darshan:_ We do see Go being adopted worldwide by majority of the companies, big and small for developing quality software products. More interestingly the community is really powerful and the rate at which the adoption is going now is mind blowing.

**Qs**. What is your impression about the Go programming scene in India?

_Darshan:_ We are at a very initial stages of adoption in India but since the community is growing very fast we are excited to be a part of it. The technology community has embraced it very well which will speed up the adoption in the Indian tech scene.

**Qs**. Why did you decide to sponsor GopherConIndia?

_Darshan:_ We believe in the open source community and the whole movement around it. Go as a language fits in perfectly with some of our company goals within the open source community. The Indian community around Go is very vibrant and we wanted to support the community.
