GopherConIndia spoke to Baishampayan Ghose (BG), Co-Founder at Helpshift Inc. (GopherConIndia's Media Sponsor).

Qs. Can you tell us about your company and what you'll do?

_BG:_ Helpshift is a mobile customer support SaaS company. We've built a customizable toolset that development teams can embed into their mobile applications and use as a customer management platform.

Our unique solution is trusted by more than 150 million users and leading mobile companies of the world including Supercell, Glu, Wordpress and the Times Group.

**Qs**. What are your company's future plans?

_BG:_ Mobile is a huge opportunity. We are focusing on fixing Customer Support on Mobile first and then we'll see where we go next. Nevertheless, at our core we are a technology driven company and we'll always be weilding technology to solve hard business problems.

**Qs**. Are you using Go or planning on it?

_BG:_ Helpshift is a polyglot platform. We use different programming languages depending on our needs, skillsets, etc.

We have been using Go in production since 2011 or so. We have a couple of microservices written in Go and as we speak we are expanding our usage of Go with a new distributed-systems project that's being written completely in Go.

**Qs**. Where do you see Go in the foreseeable future?

_BG:_ The world is distributed, parallel & concurrent. Unfortunately we've gotten used to  programming languages and techniques that assume a single thread of execution. Today the challenges of building robust software are directly related to our ability to build distributed systems.

These days, programming languages are either fast to develop or fast to execute, and very few actually handle concurrency/parallelism well.

Go sits in a nice niche where we have a clean & powerful language that allows me to build services which perform really well.

Go's development toolchain & documentation is spectacular as well.

We believe Go has a great future as a systems programming language, we see it sitting right between languages like Ruby & C++ and hence being very broadly applicable.

**Qs**. What is your impression about the Go programming scene in India?

_BG:_ Go as a language is fairly new, and as such the community is quite small/nascent. Having said that, we do see a lot of people trying out Go and that's a great sign.

**Qs**. Why did you decide to sponsor GopherConIndia?

_BG:_ We are a polyglot company and love Go. As such it was a no-brainer for us to support the first Go Conference in India :-)

_Thank you BG for sharing your views with us. In case anyone has any queries and/or questions, kindly post your questions here (as comments to this blog post) and BG would be glad to answer._
