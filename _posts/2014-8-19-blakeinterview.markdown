[Blake Mizerany](https://twitter.com/bmizerany) after starting his career as a developer at a handful of Fortune 500 companies, Blake became one of Heroku's first hires, focusing on research, development, and distributed systems engineering for the next five years. He is the creator of the Ruby framework [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) and co-creator of the distributed data store [Doozer](https://github.com/ha/doozer). Blake is an active member of the Go community, and passionate about ruthlessly simplifying developer experiences.

You can often find Blake evangelizing about the things he loves around the world, riding his bike all over San Francisco, or scaling rock walls.

Qs. Why and when did you decide to start working with Go?

_Blake:_ Early on at Heroku, I wished for a language, that would allow me to solve the problems we faced, better than languages like Ruby and Java. My wish came true in 2009 when Go was released. I never looked back.

**Qs**. Where do you see Go in the foreseeable future?

_Blake:_ Distributed Systems, command line clients, web applications, APIs, almost everywhere.

**Qs**. How should one go about acquiring knowledge and skills in Go? What's the best approach?

_Blake:_ [golang.org](http://golang.org/) and the Go stdlib (the standard library).

**Qs**. Which areas in Go should a would-be Go programmer concentrate on, in your opinion?

_Blake:_ Interfaces, then concurrency.

**Qs**. How excited are you about GopherConIndia 2015?

_Blake:_ Very!

**Qs**. Do you have any parting words for our readers? Anything you would like to share with them?

_Blake:_ Fight most urges to introduce dependencies. :)

_Thanks Blake for sharing your views with us. I am confident that your insights would help all the would-be Go programmers. In case you have any queries and/or questions, kindly post your questions here (as comments to this blog post) and Blake would be glad to answer._
