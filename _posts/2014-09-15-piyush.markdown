Piyush will be talking at GopherConIndia 2015 on "Gottp: A micro backend framework in Go."

Talk Abstract: So you want to start building a backed using Go, but think that would be too much work since there is no ready/light framework available? Gottp is not your regular front end server to do customer facing websites, it has been designed using backend servers in mind. It offers a variety of features like Call Aggregation using Asynchronous or Blocking Pipes very much like Batch requests in Graph API - [https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/making-multiple-requests](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/making-multiple-requests)

The project is hosted at [http://simversity.github.io/gottp/](http://simversity.github.io/gottp/) and currently being used in production to power a lot of our backend services at Siminars.com.

_Please feel free to post here your thoughts/suggestions about his proposed talk._
