[Francesc Campoy Flores](https://twitter.com/francesc) joined the Go team in 2012 as a Developer Advocate after several years as a Python and C++ developer. His mission is to make Go useful and fun.

Qs. Why and when did you decide to start working with Go?

_Francesc:_ I joined the Go team in August 2013 after many years of C++ and Python development. I saw the opportunity to work with a group of brilliant people in a very interesting project, and I couldn't let it pass.

**Qs**. What are you currently working on?

_Francesc:_ I'm working on a new version of the Go tour, new talks, and better learning resources for the whole Go community. In addition to that I have some side projects related to music, playing with the idea of live programming on Go.

**Qs**. Where do you see Go in the foreseeable future?

_Francesc:_ I see it as a day to day language, both in the industry but also, and specially, in schools.

**Qs**. How should one go about acquiring knowledge and skills in Go? What's the best approach?

_Francesc:_ The best approach, after going through the [tour](http://tour.golang.org/#1) and other basic materials, is to get started writing code solving actual problems. And of course joining [Go nuts](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/golang-nuts) and ask feedback from the community. A lot of gophers will help you improve your style.

**Qs**. Which areas in Go should a would-be Go programmer concentrate on, in your opinion?

_Francesc:_ Simplicity, simplicity, and simplicity. And concurrency. But seriously, simplicity is the most important aspect of Go. Avoid overengineering and rather than having huge monolithic code bases make simple pieces that play well together.

**Qs**. How excited are you about GopherConIndia 2015?

_Francesc:_ Very! Really looking forward to meet new gophers and get to learn from their experiences.

**Qs**. Do you have any parting words for our readers? Anything you would like to share with them?

_Francesc:_ See you soon, gophers! 

_Thanks Francesc for sharing your views with us. I am confident that your insights would help all the would-be Go programmers. In case you have any queries and/or questions, kindly post your questions here (as comments to this blog post) and Francesc would be glad to answer._
