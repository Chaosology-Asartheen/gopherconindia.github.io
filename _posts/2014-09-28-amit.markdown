[Amit Upadhyay](https://twitter.com/amitu), "amitu", is the VP-Engineering of BrowserStack. Previously Amit has worked with startups in India, US and Chile. An open source enthusiast and evangelist, he is the creator of [importd](http://amitu.com/importd/#1), and a [few other open source projects](https://github.com/amitu).

Amit will be talking at GopherConIndia 2015 on "An alternate approach to data."

Talk Abstract: We all love our SQL databases, and the the NoSQL ones, but access to golang, with close to native performance, and ease of writing services, provides us with a totally different approach to data, storing data in memory in applicate dependent data structures.

This talk will discuss the pros and cons of doing data yourself, vs using other databases, various complications and gotchas that may be encountered, and technical review of a server I wrote, which deals with persistence, testing and migrations.

_Please feel free to post here your thoughts/suggestions about his proposed talk._
