[Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.co.in/events/gopherconindia?af=3330229&c=Gopher&alsm=1) connects travelers seeking authentic experiences with hosts offering unique, inspiring spaces around the world. Whether an apartment for a night, a castle for a week, or a villa for a month, Airbnb connects people to unique travel experiences, at any price point, in more than 34,000 cities and 190 countries. And with world-class customer service and a growing community of users, Airbnb is the easiest way for people to monetize their extra space and showcase it to an audience of millions. Founded in August of 2008 and based in San Francisco, California, Airbnb is a trusted community marketplace for people to list, discover, and book unique accommodations around the world â€” online or from a mobile phone.

We are happy to extend our full support for this exciting event and proud to be honored as Accommodation Partner for GopherConIndia 2015. Looking forward to this great event and hope it turns out to be a huge success.
