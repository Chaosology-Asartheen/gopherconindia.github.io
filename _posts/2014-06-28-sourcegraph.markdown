[Sourcegraph](https://sourcegraph.com/) is a code search site that lets you find real-world usage examples from around the open-source world. Search for functions, explore fully linked source files, and see everywhere else a given function, package, class, etc., is used, even in other repositories. The right example is worth 1,000 words of documentation, so Sourcegraph helps you code more efficiently and discover new techniques.

We're excited to support GopherConIndia because we love connecting with our large userbase in India - and we love Go (our whole site is built in Go). For those new to Go, try using Sourcegraph to learn by example, and for experienced Go devs, use Sourcegraph to see how other Go experts use various packages. Go GopherConIndia!
